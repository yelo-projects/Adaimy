Simplify CMS Admin ("simplify") Module
#########################################################

About
-----------------------------------------------

Simplify allows you to customise the Silverstripe admin interface without any coding, 
simply by setting security permissions.

Features:

- Simplify the Silverstripe admin, provides an easy way of turning features on and off
- Make your CMS Admin easier to use for non-technical end-users
- Permission based, so you can enable options for some users but not others.
- Hide any Page, Tab or Field in the CMS
- Customise the buttons on the TinyMCE HTML editor
- Over 24 new permissions to fully configure how the admin looks
- Easily add in your own custom Simplify permissions  
- Supports i18n of permission descriptions


IMPORTANT CAVEATS:
	1.	Simplify currently hides most elements using CSS and JS. 
		A determined end user could still read or execute these hidden elements. 
		It is a future goal of the Simplify module to remove these elements from the backend.

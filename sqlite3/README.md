Requirements
------------
SilverStripe 2.4 or newer


Installation
------------
download, unzip and copy the sqlite3 folder to your project root so that it becomes a sibling of cms, sapphire and co.

either use the installer to automatically install SQLite or add this to your _config.php (right after "require_once("conf/ConfigureFromEnv.php");" if you are using _ss_environment.php)

	$databaseConfig['type'] = 'SQLiteDatabase';

you are done!

make sure the webserver has sufficient privileges to write to that folder and that it is protected from external access.


Sample mysite/_config.php
-------------------------

	<?php

	global $project;
	$project = 'mysite';

	global $database;
	$database = 'SS_mysite';

	require_once("conf/ConfigureFromEnv.php");

	global $databaseConfig;

	$databaseConfig = array(
		"type" => 'SQLiteDatabase',
		"server" => 'none',
		"username" => 'none',
		"password" => 'none',
		"database" => $database,
		"path" => "/path/to/my/database/file",
	);

	SSViewer::set_theme('blackcandy');
	SiteTree::enable_nested_urls();

Again: make sure that the webserver has permission to read and write to the above path (/path/to/my/database/, 'file' would be the name of the sqlite db file)

URL parameter
-------------
If you're trying to change a field constrain to NOT NULL on a field that contains NULLs dev/build fails because it might corrupt existing records. In order to perform the action anyway add the URL parameter 'avoidConflict' when running dev/build which temporarily adds a conflict clause to the field spec.
E.g.: http://www.my-project.com/?avoidConflict=1

Open Issues
-----------
- SQLite3 is supposed to work with all may not work with certain modules as they are using custom SQL statements passed to the DB class directly ;(
- there is no real fulltext search yet and the build-in search engine is not ordering by relevance, check out fts3
